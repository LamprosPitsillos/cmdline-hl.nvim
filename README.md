## Installation
Requires:   
treesitter `regex` parser  
nvim-0.9.0+
```lua

}
```
Default config:
```lua

    {
        'Sam-programs/cmdline-hl.nvim',
        event = 'VimEnter',
        config = function()

                    -- showcmd is true if the command should be displayed or to only show the icon
                    -- pat is used to extract the part of the command that needs highlighting
                    -- the part is matched against the raw command you don't need to worry about ranges
                    -- e.g. in '<,>'s/foo/bar/
                    -- pat is checked against s/foo/bar

                ghost_text_provider = require("cmdline-hl.ghost_text").history,
                -- you can also use this to get the wildmenu(default completion)'s suggestion

                })
        end
    }
}
```
## Aliasing
You can alias builtin commands you can read [aliases.md](/aliases.md) for examples.

## Known issues
Since this uses messages if something echos anything the command-line will disappear, But that's unlikely to happen while editing the command-line, 
I still made a function `disable_msgs` to disable messages in the command-line you can call it with `require('cmdline-hl').disable_msgs()` make sure to call it before your notification plugin loads if you have any.

~~The Press-Enter prompt appears incorrectly when using multiptle commands e.g. `:ls<cr>:ls` you could fix it by pressing space once u see the prompt.~~
ðŸ”¨ got fixed by some sort of side effect? (this is why you should make good git commits)

Errors in nested command-lines will still render the command-line, e.g. `:<C-r>=f<cr>` raises an error the plugin will keep rendering the cmdline until the user exits the command-line,  
When the Press-Enter bug happens this issue is fixed.
